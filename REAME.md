# An entry tracker

- This can be be used in places like the bus terminal where the same bus comes and goes, keeps track of people that comes in and people that goes out.
- Starts the day with zero number of passengers and then records the number of people that comes in after that keeps track of people as they get down, the number decrease too.
- Then, the number of people entries are saved and the number of people's exit are saved as well.
- what makes this little code amazing is that it helps to keep track of turns and also daily progress.
  So, you can keep track of how many times you've carried people and as well the statistics of the people you carried.
